No one really had houses made of brick or cement. They had huts made of sticks, straw, leaves, etc. Now this wasn&#x27;t an easy task to be living outdoors 24/7, but they were used to it. Imagine living out in the wild with barely anything but animals which were food, and some (hopefully) clean lakes which was a water resource?</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NGR_2009-021909-D052_%285654697437%29.jpg/800px-NGR_2009-021909-D052_%285654697437%29.jpg" alt="Hut Image (if you see this then something is broken)" class="w-64 rounded transition hover:skew-y-6 hover:skew-x-3 drop-shadow-lg"/></div><div class="drop-shadow-2xl py-8"><div class="bg-slate-900 text-white pb-8"><div class="grid place-content-center"><h2 class="p-4 text-5xl font-extrabold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-500 to-pink-500">The New Way (Wyatt)</h2></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pl-64"><p class="text-right">Nowadays, everything is automated. Some tools are made with a CNC machine, where you take a slab of material and cut it down until it represents what you want. A computer gets an object that it needs to cut a block down to and it computes paths for the drill to take to make what you want. This is pretty wasteful since it can be hard to reuse the scraps that are sawed off.</p><img src="https://www.uti.edu/images/default-source/racetrack-pages/common-types-of-cnc-machines.jpg?sfvrsn=5297b630_1" alt="CNC Machine (if you see this then something is broken)" class="w-96 rounded transition hover:skew-y-6 hover:skew-x-3 drop-shadow-lg"/></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 p-3 pr-64"><div class="grid place-content-end p-4"><img src="https://www.creality3dofficial.com/files/goods/20210917/Ender-3PRO.jpg" alt="3D Printer (if you see this then something is broken)" class="w-48 rounded transition hover:skew-y-6 hover:skew-x-3 drop-shadow-lg"/></div><p>Other tools are made using a 3D printer, which starts with a roll of material, and constructively makes the thing by making layers of materials. This is *extremely* slow, but due to new innovations in materials, a resin printer can go almost 20x faster because instead of doing one line of one layer at a time, it goes 1 layer at a time.</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pl-64"><p class="text-right">However, for something that is probably used more today, people make tools assisted with machines that can help them.
