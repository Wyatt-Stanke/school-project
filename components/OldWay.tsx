					Everyone back then thought they were geniuses if they used a
					stick, and a rock to make a slingshot. Which was probably
					really interesting for people back then. But our interesting
					nowadays is the iPhone 13. Now try to compare an iPhone 13
					to a slingshot made of rocks and sticks.

					The only ways people really survived back then was because
					of huts. No one really had houses made of brick or cement.
					They had huts made of sticks, straw, leaves, etc. Now this
					wasn&apos;t an easy task to be living outdoors 24/7, but
					they were used to it. Imagine living out in the wild with
					barely anything but animals which were food, and some
					(hopefully) clean lakes which was a water resource?
